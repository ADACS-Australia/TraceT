Uploading a test VOEvent
------------------------
You can use the `testing <https://mwa-trigger.duckdns.org/test_upload_xml/>`_ page of TraceT to upload a test VOEvent XML file.

This will be treated as a real event so ensure that all proposals are in testing mode if you do not want to trigger observations.

You can copy and paste the contents of an XML file into the text box and edit its RA and Dec to ensure it's above the horizon.
You should also change the group event ID (normally labelled as TrigID), so TraceT knows to treat it as a new event group.
